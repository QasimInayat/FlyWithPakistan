								<br><br><h4>BOOKING</h4>
								<br><h5>IS IT SAFE TO BOOK A TICKET ONLINE?<h5>
								<p id="faqp">We make our best efforts, including taking reasonable technical and security actions, for the protection and safe storage of your personal data and to protect your personal data from unauthorised access, utilisation, being tampered with or unauthorised deletion. We pay special attention to the safe transmission of personal and financial data. This data is transmitted from your computer to the booking server of Wizz Air through encrypted channels with the support of the state-of-the-art Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Moreover we offer a new online security service for VISA and MasterCard cardholders. Verified by VISA and MasterCard Secure Code schemes enable you to register an additional password to your credit card. By doing this you will help to prevent unauthorised purchases on your credit card which means that you can shop online with added security and peace of mind. During check-out, if your bank is participating, you will be asked to register for either scheme. Simply follow the online instructions to set up your new password. Some banks do offer an option to sign up later, but others will insist that you sign up to the scheme immediately in order for you to complete your online transaction. These schemes will soon become compulsory for all cardholders. If you have any questions about the scheme please contact your card issuer directly.</p>
								<br><h5>CAN I BOOK CONNECTING FLIGHTS?</h5>
								<p id="faqp">Wizz Air does not operate connecting flights and therefore cannot facilitate the transfer of passengers or their baggage to other flights (whether operated by Wizz Air or other air carriers). For this reason, we do not accept liability for any onward flights passengers may miss. We strongly advise you to allow sufficient time between the scheduled time of arrival of the incoming flight and the scheduled time of departure of the onward flight.</p>
								<br><h5>WHEN IS MY RESERVATION CONFIRMED?</h5>
								<p id="faqp">If you paid with a credit/debit card, upon completing the reservation process you will receive a confirmation page (on screen) and a copy will be sent to you via e-mail. If you have not received the confirmation e-mail (Itinerary) please check your e-mail filter settings and any mailboxes that hold filtered mail. Your itinerary will include your confirmation code, dates, total fare, and all other necessary details. This information can be accessed through your Wizz Air Profile under ’my bookings’ section if your booking was made while you were logged in.</p>
								<br><br><h4>CHILDREN AND INFANTS</h4><br><br>
								<h5>HOW CAN I TRAVEL WITH MY CHILD/INFANT?</h5>
								<p id="faqp">Infants up to the age of 2 may fly for an infant fee, in the accompanying adult's lap, however, if the price of the accompanying one–way adult fare is lower than the current fees, the same amount will be applied for the infant fee. No more than 1 infant per accompanying person is allowed. The infant fee may be paid online during the booking process or through the Call Centre. For more information, please view the booking children page. Infants must be under the age of 2 for both the departure and the return flight. Should the infant reach the age of 2 after the departure and before the return journey, a seat must be purchased and in such case separate reservations should be created for the onward and return flights. Children over the age of two will not be allowed to travel in the accompanying adult’s lap.</p>
								<br><h5>IS AN INFANT ENTITLED TO ANY BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE?</h5>
								<p id="faqp">Infants are not entitled to any baggage allowance with the exception of a pushchair / foldable baby carriage / infant car seat per infant (carried free of charge). One of these items will also be carried free of charge for children (between the age of 2 years and 14 years old). Please note that prams and pushchairs shall be checked in with other baggage and will be carried free of charge only if the user of the equipment is travelling. However if no infant or child is involved, these items will be carried as checked-in baggage for an additional fee.</p>
								<br><br><h4>GROUP BOOKING</H4><br><br>
								<h5>HOW CAN I BOOK TICKETS FOR A GROUP?</h5>
								<p id="faqp">If you want to make a reservation for a group between 11 and 50 passengers and at least 15 days prior to departure you can search for flights and book online via wizzair.com. You need to register or login to book groups.. If your departure date is within 14 days of booking or your group includes over 50 passengers, your request will be submitted and you will be notified by email within two working days when your seats are available to book on wizzair.com. Please note that group ticket prices do not include baggage fee, airport check-in and other services. You will be able to select your flights and dates and submit your selection online. Please note that special promotions are not applicable to groups. </p>
								<br><h5>WHEN DO I HAVE TO SEND THE NAME OF PASSENGERS?</h5>
								<p id="faqp">Passengers’ names should be provided online via wizzair.com no later than 72 hours prior to departure. The names can only be provided once full payment has been received. Please ensure that you have received a final confirmation email (with the passengers’ names) before your travel, as the passenger name upload may not have been received by us and you might be required to pay Name Change fee for each passenger. If you have not received the email two working days prior to your departure date, please request it by contacting the Call Centre.</p>
