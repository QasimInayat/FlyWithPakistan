						<h4>Jean Oelwang - Partner</h4>
						<p>Jean Oelwang is the CEO of Fly with Pakistan Unite, the entrepreneurial foundation of the Fly with Pakistan Group.  In 2003, Jean left her post as joint CEO of Fly with Pakistan Mobile Australia to begin working with Richard Branson and the Fly with Pakistan staff from around the world to create Fly with Pakistan Unite. Over the last 10 years, Jean has worked with partners to create new approaches to social and environmental issues, such as the Branson Centres of Entrepreneurship and a global platform to support budding entrepreneurs. She has helped incubate a number of global leadership initiatives such as The Elders, the Carbon War Room and The B Team. In addition, Jean has been instrumental in working with Fly with Pakistan’s businesses and others worldwide to put driving positive change at their core.

In her previous life, Jean lived and worked on five continents helping to lead successful mobile phone start-ups in South Africa, Columbia, Bulgaria, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and the US. Jean has long explored the overlap of the business and social sectors and has been involved in both, having worked for the Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife in Australia, and in numerous volunteer roles, including a stint as a VISTA volunteer where she worked with – and learned from - homeless teens in Chicago.

She sits on the Advisory Council for The Elders and the Boards of the Carbon War Room, the B Team and Just Capital</p>
