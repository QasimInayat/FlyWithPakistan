								<br><br><h4>CHECKED IN BAGGAGE</h4>
								<br><h5>HOW MANY BAGGAGES CAN I CHECK IN?<h5>
								<p id="faqp">You can check in up to 6 pieces of baggage not exceeding 32 kilograms each. Each piece of baggage to be checked-in is subject to a baggage fee, payable per bag, per flight and per passenger. The first 3 pieces can be purchased online, the subsequent 3 at the airport. The number of bags to be checked-in must be indicated and paid during the booking process. Further pieces of baggage can be added at a later stage, either online or via the Call Centre. Additional pieces of checked-in baggage purchased at the airport will be subject to a higher baggage fee; the amount will depend on whether it is purchased at the check-in counter or we are forced to check-in an oversized or overweight hand baggage at the boarding gate. If your flight is operated by Wizz Air Ukraine (airline code WAU) the first piece of checked-in hold baggage is carried free of charge. Each subsequent piece of baggage to be checked-in is subject to a baggage fee, payable per bag, per flight and per passenger. The second and third pieces can be purchased online, the subsequent 3 at the airport. The number of bags to be checked-in must be indicated and paid during the booking process. Further pieces of baggage can be added at a later stage, either online or via the Call Centre. Additional pieces of checked-in baggage purchased at the airport will be subject to a higher baggage fee; the amount will depend on whether it is purchased at the check-in counter or we are forced to check-in an oversized or overweight hand baggage at the boarding gate. If fewer pieces of baggage are checked-in, the baggage fee will not be refunded. .</p>
								<br><h5>I ALREADY HAVE A RESERVATION. HOW CAN I BUY ADDITIONAL PIECES OF BAGGAGE?</h5>
								<p id="faqp">Wizz Air does not operate connecting flights and therefore cannot facilitate the transfer of passengers or their baggage to other flights (whether operated by Wizz Air or other air carriers). For this reason, we do not accept liability for any onward flights passengers may miss. We strongly advise you to allow sufficient time between the scheduled time of arrival of the incoming flight and the scheduled time of departure of the onward flight.</p>
								<br><h5>WHAT SHOULD I DO IF MY BAGGAGE IS LOST?</h5>
								<p id="faqp">It is possible to add baggage to your booking through our website and our Call Centre. 
Please note that if you purchase your baggage at the airport, you may be required to pay an additional fee at airport agent beyond the baggage fee . Exact info of the additional rates charged by the handling agent can be enquired from the airport</p>
								<br><br><h4>CABIN BAGGAGE</h4><br><br>
								<h5>WHAT ARE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE HAND BAGGAGE?</h5>
								<p id="faqp">No. You can carry either one small, or one large cabin bag. Goods purchased at the airport after security will be allowed in the cabin for free!</p>
								<br><h5>IS AN INFANT ENTITLED TO ANY BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE?</h5>
								<p id="faqp">Infants are not entitled to any baggage allowance with the exception of a pushchair / foldable baby carriage / infant car seat per infant (carried free of charge). One of these items will also be carried free of charge for children (between the age of 2 years and 14 years old). Please note that prams and pushchairs shall be checked in with other baggage and will be carried free of charge only if the user of the equipment is travelling. However if no infant or child is involved, these items will be carried as checked-in baggage for an additional fee.</p>
